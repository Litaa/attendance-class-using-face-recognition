# Face Recognition Quiz

## Haar Cascade
___
1. Haar cascade is an algorithm that used to identify object in an image or video. What is the limitation of this algorithm?
  - [ ] It won't be able to recognize partially covered faces 
  - [ ] Its complexity in computation
  - [ ] It requires dozens of experiments.
___

2. Which one the statement below is TRUE about adaptive boosting?
  - [ ] The main idea of adaptive boosting is used to boost the classification performance of a simple or weak classifier to minimize the error rate.
  - [ ] The main idea of adaptive boosting is used to boost the classification performance of a simple or weak classifier to maximize the error rate.
  - [ ] The main idea of adaptive boosting is used to boost the classification performance from strong classifier to minimize the error rate
___

3. What does the Haar algorithm do in Integral images process?
  - [ ] It converts input image into integral image and then define the features by adding the sum of pixels under a bright rectangle and the sum of pixels under the dark rectangle
  - [ ] It converts input image into integral image and then define the features by substract the sum of pixels under a bright rectangle from the sum of pixels under the dark rectangle
  - [ ] It substracts the sum of pixels under a bright rectangle from the sum of pixels under the dark rectangle in the inputed image
___
  

## Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH)
4. When performing face recognition, algorithm will return confidence measurement value. what does actually the confidence is?
  - [ ] The distance between the center point pixel and the neighboring pixel
  - [ ] The distance between each features in training data
  - [ ] The distance between histogram training data and histrogram test data
  - [ ] There is no right answer
___

5. Based on matrix "kuis.JPG" image, find the binary value and then convert into decimal value to calculate new central value. What is the  result?

  - [ ] 168
___

6. By rescaling the input image, we can resize a larger face into the smaller one and making it detectable by the algorithm. Say I want to resize my image by 6%, what does the correct parameter for the code?
